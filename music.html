<h6> Music has always been a big part of my life. The first instrument I learned to play was the piano at age 5. Since then, I have learned how to play the guitar, bass, ukulele, drums, saxophone, and picked up other various music skills. I began writing music as soon as I learned how to play the piano but other than writing those songs into books or memorizing my pieces, it was not until later on in life I really learned how to record, write, and produce music. I am proficient in recording softwares such as Logic and ProTools, and have worked in various other Digital Audio Workstations. </h6>
