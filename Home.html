<br>
University of New Haven is located in West Haven, Connecticut. This establishment offers many disciplines. Here students can further their career path and experience a higher educational experience. I haven't been to all my classes, but all the classes I did go to I learned something. Stay in school ( or don't) don't do drugs (or do), Kony 2012.

The University of New Haven offers a lot of "Fun Stuff" both on campus and near by city's. The city of New Haven offers a lot of local foods, bars, and shopping strips. On campus I was involved with the club lacrosse team and had a FUN time. My friends and I like going hiking, and traveling places. The area has a lot of different activities to offer. Please see your local listing for weekly activities.
